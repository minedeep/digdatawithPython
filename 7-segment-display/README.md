# Convert a decimal number to 7-segment format display with Django

I am assuming that you have Python setup properly and other libraries necessary to run a server and display an html page with Django. If you do not know how to have all these setup, please visit my other posts about building a basic ecommerce system with Python, Django, MySQL here

Here I am showing a shortest Python-program that converts decimal numbers to the 7-segment display format and to be displayed on an HTML page. The decimal number is a user input from a text box and fed into the program as a string. The program will output a corresponding 7-segment formatted string.
